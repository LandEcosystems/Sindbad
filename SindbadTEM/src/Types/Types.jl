    Types

The `Types` module consolidates and organizes all the types used in the SINDBAD framework into a central location. This ensures a single source for type definitions, promoting consistency and reusability across all SINDBAD packages. It also provides helper functions and utilities for working with these types.

# Purpose:
This module serves as the backbone for type definitions in SINDBAD, ensuring modularity and extensibility. It provides a unified hierarchy for SINDBAD-specific types and includes utilities for introspection, type manipulation, and documentation.

# Dependencies:
- `InteractiveUtils`: Enables interactive exploration and debugging during development.
- `Base.Docs`: Provides documentation utilities for type introspection.

# Included Files:
1. **`ModelTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for models in SindbadTEM, representing various model/processes.

2. **`TimeTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for handling time-related operations, managing temporal aggregation of data.

3. **`SpinupTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for spinup processes in SindbadTEM, handling methods for initialization and equilibrium states.

4. **`LandTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for collecting variables from `land` and saving them, building land and array structures for model execution.

5. **`ArrayTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for array structures used in SindbadTEM, providing specialized array types for efficient data handling.

6. **`InputTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for input data and configurations, managing input flows and forcing data.

7. **`SimulationTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for experiments conducted in SindbadTEM, representing experimental setups, configurations, and results.

8. **`ParameterOptimizationTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for optimization-related functions and methods, separating methods for optimization, cost functions, etc.

9. **`MetricsTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines types for metrics used to evaluate model performance, representing performance metrics and cost evaluation.

10. **`MachineLearningTypes.jl`**:
    - Defines types for machine learning components, supporting machine learning workflows and data structures.

11. **`LongTuple.jl`**:
    - Provides definitions and methods for working with `longTuple` type, facilitating operations on tuples with many elements.

12. **`TypesFunctions.jl`**:
    - Provides helper functions related to SINDBAD types, including utilities for introspection, type manipulation, and documentation.

13. **`docStringForTypes.jl`**:
    - Auto-generated documentation that appends type docstrings to the main module for discoverability.

# Notes:
- The `Types` module serves as the backbone for type definitions in SINDBAD, ensuring modularity and extensibility.
- Each type is documented with its purpose via the `purpose` function, making it easier for developers to understand and extend the framework.
- The `SindbadTypes` abstract type serves as the base for all Julia types in the SINDBAD framework.

# Examples:
1. **Querying type purpose**:
```julia
using SindbadTEM.Types
purpose(BayesOptKMaternARD5)  # Returns the purpose string for the type
```

2. **Working with SINDBAD types**:
```julia
using SindbadTEM.Types
# All SINDBAD types are available through this module
```

        purpose(T::Type)

    Returns a string describing the purpose of a type in the SINDBAD framework.

    # Description
    - This is a base function that should be extended by each package for their specific types.
    - When in SINDBAD models, purpose is a descriptive string that explains the role or functionality of the model or approach within the SINDBAD framework. If the purpose is not defined for a specific model or approach, it provides guidance on how to define it.
    - When in SINDBAD lib, purpose is a descriptive string that explains the dispatch on the type for the specific function. For instance, metricTypes.jl has a purpose for the types of metrics that can be computed.


    # Arguments
    - `T::Type`: The type whose purpose should be described

    # Returns
    - A string describing the purpose of the type
        
    # Example
    ```julia
    # Define the purpose for a specific model
    purpose(::Type{BayesOptKMaternARD5}) = "Bayesian Optimization using Matern 5/2 kernel with Automatic Relevance Determination from BayesOpt.jl"

    # Retrieve the purpose
    println(purpose(BayesOptKMaternARD5))  # Output: "Bayesian Optimization using Matern 5/2 kernel with Automatic Relevance Determination from BayesOpt.jl"
    ```
