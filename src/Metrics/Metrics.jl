    Metrics

The `Metrics` module provides tools for evaluating the performance of SINDBAD models. It includes a variety of metrics for comparing model outputs with observations, calculating statistical measures, and updating model parameters based on evaluation results.

# Purpose:
This module is designed to define and compute metrics that assess the accuracy and reliability of SINDBAD models. It supports a wide range of statistical and performance metrics, enabling robust model evaluation and calibration.

It has heavy usage in `Sindbad.ParameterOptimization` but the module is separated to reduce import burdens of optimization schemes. This allows for import into independent workflows for model evaluation and parameter estimation, e.g., in hybrid modeling.

# Dependencies:
- `SindbadTEM`: Provides the core SINDBAD models and types.
- `SindbadTEM.Utils`: Provides utility functions for handling data and NamedTuples, which are essential for metric calculations.

# Included Files:
1. **`handleDataForLoss.jl`**:
   - Implements functions for preprocessing and handling data before calculating loss functions or metrics.

2. **`getMetric.jl`**:
   - Provides functions for retrieving and organizing metrics based on model outputs and observations.

3. **`metric.jl`**:
   - Contains the core metric definitions, including statistical measures (e.g., RMSE, correlation) and custom metrics for SINDBAD experiments.

# Notes:
- The module is designed to be extensible, allowing users to define custom metrics for specific use cases.
- Metrics are computed in a modular fashion, ensuring compatibility with SINDBAD's optimization and evaluation workflows.
- Supports both standard statistical metrics and domain-specific metrics tailored to SINDBAD experiments.

# Examples:
1. **Calculating RMSE**:
```julia
using SindbadTEM.Metrics
rmse = metric(model_output, observations, RMSE())
```

2. **Computing correlation**:
```julia
using SindbadTEM.Metrics
correlation = metric(model_output, observations, Pcor())
```
