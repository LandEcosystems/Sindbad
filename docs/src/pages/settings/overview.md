# SINDBAD Configuration Overview

SINDBAD provides a flexible configuration system that adapts to different model structures and data integration approaches, tailored to specific scientific objectives and challenges.

Unlike traditional modeling experiments that require code modifications or additional scripts, SINDBAD uses **JSON configuration files** to define all necessary settings for running experiments. This approach enables seamless integration of terrestrial ecosystem models with various model-data integration strategies.

## Configuration Files

The following table outlines SINDBAD's main configuration files:

| # | File | Required | Purpose |
|:--|:-----|:--------:|:--------|
| 1 | [Experiment](experiment.md) | Yes | Defines experiment basics and simulation settings |
| 2 | [Forcing](forcing.md) | Yes | Configures forcing dataset specifications |
| 3 | [Model Structure](model_structure.md) | Yes | Defines model processes and pools |
| 4 | [ParameterOptimization](optimization.md) | No | Configures parameter optimization and model performance evaluation |
| 5 | [Parameters](parameters.md) | No | Specifies non-default parameter values for experiments |

::: tip Best Practices
- Store all configuration files for an experiment in a dedicated directory within the **settings_*** folder of your SINDBAD experiments directory
- Use descriptive file names that clearly associate configurations with specific experiments
- Maintain a clear naming convention to ensure traceability and reproducibility
- Reference the example configurations in the ```examples``` directory as templates

::: info Configuration Management
- Each experiment should have its own configuration directory
- Version control your configuration files to track changes
- Document any modifications to default settings
- Keep configuration files organized and well-documented
